    "Machine learning model bias can arise from dataset composition: correlated sensitive features can distort the downstream classification model's decision boundary and lead to performance differences along these features. To this end, we propose a novel framework to extract comprehensive biases in image datasets based on textual descriptions, a common sense-rich modality. Specifically, features are constructed by clustering noun phrase embeddings with similar semantics. The presence of each feature across the dataset is inferred, and their co-occurrence statistics are measured, with spurious correlations optionally examined by a human-in-the-loop module. Our method uncovers novel model biases in multiple image benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the discovered bias can be mitigated by simple data re-weighting to de-correlate the features, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

    "Over the past decade, the generative capabilities of machine learning systems has undergone transformational development, enabling high-quality data synthesis at previously unthinkable levels. Until now, these advances have been largely confined to the image and language modalities, where usable data is abundant. Now, 3D generative modeling promises to carry this revolution beyond words and pixels, bringing it into the world we inhabit. These developments motivate the desire to connect language and 3D modalities to allow user control over 3D tools and give them access to the vast knowledge present in existing text corpuses. To accomplish this, we introduce several works which demonstrate the value of representing 3D data as language, simplifying the problem of connecting the two domains. We show the effectiveness of this approach for 3D generative modeling for the generation of both physical assets (e.g 3D printing) as well as digital assets.",
