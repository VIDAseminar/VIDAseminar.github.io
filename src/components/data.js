    'One of the most fundamental problems in statistics is the method of moments: given the moments of a probability distribution, the goal is to estimate the distribution (or a function of it). I will show how to do this efficiently using Chebyshev polynomials, leading to an optimal and practical algorithm. Next, I will introduce differential privacy and demonstrate how to generate differentially private synthetic data using the same approach. If time permits, I will also sketch the proof. No background in distribution learning or differential privacy is assumed. This talk is based on joint work with Cameron Musco, Christopher Musco, and Lucas Rosenblatt.',
